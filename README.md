# Luxloop Unity Boilerplate

This project is pre-set up to be tracked via git, using git LFS to track assets.

Make sure you have LFS installed (you only have to do this once per machine, not per project): 
* `brew install git-lfs` or download and install the binary from [here](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases/download/v2.0.2/git-lfs-darwin-amd64-2.0.2.tar.gz)
* run `git lfs install`.

## How to Use
Once you clone this repo, rename the folder `LuxloopUnityBoilerplate` to whatever you want your project to be called and run `git remote rm origin` to remove the boilerplate repo. Don't forget to `git remote add` a remote later.

Go to `Edit > Project Settings > Player` and change the `Product Name` to the name of your project.

_(Optional) Finally, in the `Services` tab, create a new `Unity Project ID` for this project_



## Adding Filetypes to LFS
Currently, LFS handles the following file extensions:
* .jpg/.jpg
* .psd
* .png
* .tiff/tiff
* .ogg
* .stl
* .obj
* .mov
* .mp4
* .fbx
* .mp3
* .m4a
* .bin

If you need to include a binary filetype that is not in the list above, make sure to run `git lfs track "*.xxx"` **before** you commit it to your repo.
